[lover_spouse.GetSheHe|U] has been distant lately — lost in thought and rarely seen at court. Is [lover_spouse.GetSheHe] simply busy? Or could [lover_spouse.GetSheHe] be warming someone else's bed...?\n\nWhen next you see her you dive into her thoughts, scanning for signs of falsehood. But your work was thorough, and she is as loyal as you made her."

  regula_adultery.1001.desc:0 "It seems there is an interloper in your harem. [adultery_lover.GetTitledFirstName] has been fucking [lover_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] for weeks. He simply told her that it was your will, and the gullible $game_concept_compedita$ eagerly spread her legs.\n\nPart of you is impressed by [adultery_lover.GetFirstNamePossessive] audacity, but his actions were foolhardy at best. An idle question about [lover_spouse.GetFirstNamePossessive] recent whereabouts was enough to have her excitedly detail their entire relationship."

Her outrage turns quickly to shock as the room begins to dim with your power, then fear when [lover_spouse.GetFirstName] locks and bars the door.\n\nShe screams, of course, but [lover_spouse.GetFirstName] had quietly replaced the guards with those that could be trusted, and none come to her aid.

  regula_adultery.2001.desc:0 "Your creature [lover_spouse.GetTitledFirstName] is ruled as much by her lust as by your will. Unfortunately, it seems that her urges have been too strong as of late. \n\n[sex_partner.GetTitledFirstName] caught her masturbating in the stables.
