  regula_holy_site_event.1001.mediterranean:0 "In the ruins of Carthage lies a place where reality is...thinner than elsewhere. Thin enough to siphon power from a fallen goddess into one of your slaves, giving them unending vigor and improving their every talent.\n\nBut the cost will be steep. The ritual will require an immense amount of mana fused to a shred of your soul, permanently weakening you. The loss of their mortality will end any hope your slave may have of bearing another child, and the effect on their mind will be difficult to predict.\n\nThis is not a decision to be taken lightly."
  regula_holy_site_event.1001.european:0 "The meadows of Gotland contain a link to Folkvangr, the field of Freyja's fallen. The souls of these dead can be used to empower one of your slaves, giving them unending vigor and improving their every talent.\n\nBut the cost will be steep. The ritual will require an immense amount of mana fused to a shred of your soul, permanently weakening you. The loss of their mortality will end any hope your slave may have of bearing another child, and the effect on their mind will be difficult to predict.\n\nThis is not a decision to be taken lightly."

  regula_holy_site_event.1002.desc:0 "Rumours of what you do now will no likely spread far and wide, but for the moment the only witnesses have been chained so tightly to your will they move like puppets on a string. The slightest hesitance or spark of defiance from them will mean doom for you all.\n\nBut as you stare down at the dagger in your hand you pause. Does [recipient.GetFirstName] truly deserve the gift you are about to grant her?"

  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.intro:0 "As the chanting of your slaves reaches a fever pitch you are cast into darkness. "
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.diplomacy:0 "When the light returns you see before you an immense figure, wreathed in flames the colour of blood. For just a moment your eyes meet, and you hear a man scream as he dies, is consumed, then dies again. You know in your soul that the man suffers for a debt he does not owe, one he can never repay.\n\nThe light breaks once more, and you find yourself at the site of the ritual, unharmed. Your slave rises, and in her eyes you see red." # 
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.martial:0 "As the light returns you find yourself surrounded by smoke and ash, the smell of blood and bile in the air. You are on a battlefield, the site of a one-sided slaughter like none you've ever seen. At its centre a great figure is hunched, her hands rending the bodies of the fallen. With each pull she tears off a new arm, sowing it with sinew and flesh into a profane mockery of grace.\n\nFortunately, before the figure notices you the smoke fades, and you find yourself at the site of the ritual once more. Your slave rises, and as you look at her you smell smoke." # 
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.stewardship:0 "The darkness clears in a blinding flash of light, and you see before you an immense figure lounging over a narrow pass. Her eyes are the colour of gold, and rivulets of the same metal pour from her breasts. Coiling around her is stream of petitioners, but somehow you know that whatever gifts these supplicants receive will leave them less than they once were.\n\nSoon the light fades, and when you can see once more you find yourself back at the site of the ritual. Your slave rises, and in your head you hear the clink of coins." # 
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.intrigue:0 "Before you can take stock of your surroundings you are struck by a piercing wail. Before you hovers figure clad in rivulets of blood, her hair waving in a wind you can not feel. Grasping at her feet is a crowd of souless husks, blood coiling out from their veins to the figure above.\n\nThe wail changes pitch, and all at once becomes the most beautiful sound that you have ever heard. Desperate, you slash at the thread of mana fueling the ritual, closing the connection and sending you back to the ritual site.\n\nAs you lay gasping on the ground you hear your slave approach. When she speaks her voice keens." # 
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.desc.learning:0 "Before you glimmer a thousand tiny lights, foreign constellations against a moonless sky. Striding across this firmament is a figure shrouded in dusk so dark that you can see naught but their silhouette. As they pass each light it flickers briefly, and you realize that these are not stars, but souls.\n\nAs the vision fades you find yourself back at the site of the ritual. Your slave rises their eyes twinkle like a field of stars." # 
  regula_holy_site_event.1003.a:0 "It is done, for better or worse."
