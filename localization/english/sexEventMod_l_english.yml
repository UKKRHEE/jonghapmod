 stupidSexEventMod.1001.title: "A Stalking Wolf"
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.desc: "As I am following a trail on my own, I notice a [red_riding_hood.Custom('WomanManGirlBoy')] strolling through the forest a good distance away. I stop for a short while and look after her. Just as I am about to continue, I notice another shape behind her, grey, hardly visible. The wolf is moving smoothly, and it is definitely stalking the [red_riding_hood.Custom('WomanManGirlBoy')]."
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.a: "I ride forward, hollering as loud as I can."
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.a.tt: "Wolves are not supposed to do that. I will teach them!"
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.b: "Choose me!"
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.c: "Smirking, I turn around and leave."
 stupidSexEventMod.1001.c.tt: "One should not interfere in the forest's natural order."
 stupidSexEventMod.1002.title: "A Valiant Rescue"
 stupidSexEventMod.1002.desc: "For a few moments I concentrate on remaining firmly seated on my horse as it diligently rushes between the trees, low hanging branches passing by me right and left. When the trees clear slightly closer to my target, the wolf is nowhere to be seen. Too bad considering the hunt, but I am mostly relieved anyway.\nThe [red_riding_hood.Custom('WomanManGirlBoy')] is easy on the eyes, it would have been a pity had her [red_riding_hood.Custom('body')] become wolf grub. \nInitially confused she listens to the explanation for my rowdy behaviour, paling a bit as she understands. \nShe introduces herself as [red_riding_hood.GetFirstName] and offers to do anything to clear her debt to me personally."
 stupidSexEventMod.1002.a: "I assure her I was happy to save her and don't require additional compensation."
 stupidSexEventMod.1002.a.tt: "A good deed is it's own reward."
 stupidSexEventMod.1002.b: "I happen to have a hunting cabin nearby where we could get to that right away."
 stupidSexEventMod.1003.title: "A Deserved Reward"
 # stupidSexEventMod.1003.desc: "We arrive at the cabin and it is still empty, the rest of the hunting party will be out a few more hours. My manservant is probably about, but he knows well not to intrude too early when I bring female company. "
 stupidSexEventMod.1003.desc: "We arrive at the cabin and it is still empty, the rest of the hunting party will be out a few more hours. After a little preliminary touching, [red_riding_hood.GetFirstName] feels ready for the main event. \n[ROOT.Char.Custom2('rsg_scene_mf_enter_consensual', SCOPE.sC('red_riding_hood') )] [ROOT.Char.Custom2('rsg_scene_mf_inside_consensual', SCOPE.sC('red_riding_hood') )] \n[ROOT.Char.Custom2('rsg_scene_mf_continue_consensual', SCOPE.sC('red_riding_hood') )] [ROOT.Char.Custom2('rsg_scene_mf_continue_consensual', SCOPE.sC('red_riding_hood') )]\n\n [ROOT.Char.Custom2('rsg_scene_mf_cum_consensual', SCOPE.sC('red_riding_hood') )]"
 stupidSexEventMod.1003.a: "I deserved this."
 stupidSexEventMod.1003.a.tt: "It's good to be a hero."
