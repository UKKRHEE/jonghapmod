EVTNAME_DWBHE_200;The Guardian of the Ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_200;During your hunt, you become lost and separated from your hunting party several days in. Trying to find your way back through the thick forest, you stumble into a clearing near some old ruins. Before you can take stock of your surroundings, a lithe figure jumps down from a nearby tree branch to confront you, a stout staff in her hands. Clearly pointed ears poke out from the sides of her blonde hair, identifying her as an elf, a race thought by most to be little more than fables and legends. "Halt!" she demands, glaring at you. "I am Alleyne, the last guardian of this shrine. There is nothing of value for you to steal here, human. Only the ruins that I alone remain here to guard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE200;Leave peacefully as asked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DWBHE200;Attempt to persuade her to come with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_DWBHE200;Try to take her prisoner by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_DWBHE200;Try to take her prisoner by trickery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_201;Challenging Alleyne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_201;She smirks as you draw your weapon, your intent clear. "So it's a fight you want? You're not the first, and likely not the last either. But you're several hundred years too early for a fight with me." She drops back into a fighting stance, clearly a very experienced combatant by the look of things, and on her home terrain, at that. "Better flee while you can, outsider," she taunts. It might be difficult enough to beat her, let alone capture her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE201;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DWBHE201;Run away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_202;Alleyne defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_202;The fight is difficult, and Alleyne is clearly skilled and knowledgeable, but fighting skills tend to atrophy if not kept sharp, and hers have dulled. It takes you several minutes, but once you have an opening, you take it, knocking her staff from her hands. She refuses to surrender at first, but it isn't much longer before you have her on the ground before you, defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE202;A wonderful trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_203;Alleyne defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_203;The fight is difficult, and Alleyne is clearly skilled and knowledgeable. She manages to land a solid blow on you that will clearly leave a nasty wound, but fighting skills tend to atrophy if not kept sharp, and hers have dulled. It takes you several minutes, but once you have an opening, you take it, knocking her staff from her hands. She refuses to surrender at first, but it isn't much longer before you have her on the ground before you, defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE203;A wonderful trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_204;Alleyne escapes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_204;The fight is difficult, and Alleyne is clearly skilled and knowledgeable. She manages to land one solid blow on you, and then another, her guard nearly impenetrable, and even when you think you see an opening, she uses the terrain to her advantage, ducking behind a tree, or withdrawing while roots trip you up. She circles you for a time, but seemingly unable to land a final blow, and eventually she begins to tire. Just as you think you might be able to regain the advantage, she slips back into the forest, withdrawing from the fight, leaving you bleeding in the clearing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE204;Blast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_205;Alleyne escapes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_205;The fight is difficult, and Alleyne is clearly skilled and knowledgeable. She manages to land one solid blow on you, and then another, her guard nearly impenetrable, and even when you think you see an opening, she uses the terrain to her advantage, ducking behind a tree, or withdrawing while roots trip you up. She circles you for a time, but seemingly unable to land a final blow, until one instant when your guard slips, and her staff comes crashing down painfully, leaving you on the ground, badly injured and perhaps even maimed. She stands above you, as if considering whether to finish you off, but instead simply withdraws into the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE205;Cursed elven harlot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_206;Alleyne kills you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_206;The fight is difficult, and Alleyne is clearly skilled and knowledgeable. She manages to land one solid blow on you, and then another, her guard nearly impenetrable, and even when you think you see an opening, she uses the terrain to her advantage, ducking behind a tree, or withdrawing while roots trip you up. She circles you for a time, but seemingly unable to land a final blow, until one instant when your guard slips, and her staff comes crashing down painfully, leaving you on the ground, badly injured and perhaps even maimed. She stands above you, as if considering whether to finish you off, before the end of her staff suddenly rams downward full-force, directly at your face...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE206;Noooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_207;A subtle ambush;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_207;You explain to her that you are on a pilgrimage, seeking out ancient shrines as a rite of spiritual passage. You claim to have no ill intent, and state that you merely wish to pay your respects at the shrine, after which you will be on your way, if she will but escort you to the shrine. She stares back at you, still wary, as if considering your request, before nodding briefly in acquiesence. "Come then. It would dishonor the spirits to turn away anyone who wished to honor them, even an outsider." She turns to lead you towards the rubbled ruin, and you briefly see an opening as her back is turned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE207;Try to grab her from behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_208;Wise to your treachery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_208;She whirls around as your foot crunches on a stray pebble, jumping back just in time to dodge your lunge at her. "Thought you could trick me? You're not the first, and likely not the last either. But you're several hundred years too early for a fight with me." She drops back into a fighting stance, clearly a very experienced combatant by the look of things, and on her home terrain, at that. "Best to flee while you can, outsider," she taunts. It might be difficult enough to beat her, let alone capture her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE208;Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_DWBHE208;Run away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_209;Alleyne captured;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_209;You catch her off guard, pinning her slender arms to her body, her staff useless as you lift her off the ground slightly, the weapon easily tossed aside. You grab her wrists, and twist one of her arms behind her back, and then the other, pushing her to the ground as you begin to tie her up. She struggles against you, though you quickly disabuse her of that notion, her resistance and shouts eventually subsiding into a glower as you lead your prisoner off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_DWBHE209;A wonderful trophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_DWBHE_210;Alleyne escapes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_DWBHE_210;You catch her off guard, pinning her slender arms to her body, her staff useless as you lift her off the ground slightly, the weapon easily tossed aside. You move to grab her wrists, and twist one of her arms behind her back, but she twists around with it in a lightning-fast move, and executes a sudden throw on you, dropping you to the ground on your back, the wind rushing from your chest briefly. As you struggle to get to your feet, she darts off into the trees, disappearing into the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE119semiramis;"I am Semiramis, the Empress of Assyria," she replies, "and you trespass upon my tomb. Do you have some excuse, perhaps, or are you simply another would-be looter?" \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, her expression somewhat incredulous at first, though gradually shifting to amusement as you detail your search and the ancestral lines you discovered. \n\n "Perhaps it is as you say, that you are my descendent. But if that is true, then to earn my blessing, you must prove yourself worthy of calling yourself such - by putting your very life on the line. Will you rise to my challenge? If not, then turn tail and run now, and never return to this place.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE119mordred;"I am Mordred, the rightful heir of King Arthur," she replies, "and you're trespassing in my tomb. Better hurry up and explain, before I get bored and decide to cut you down right here." \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, her expression unreadable under the helmet visor, before she lifts it, revealing a fairly attractive blonde-haired woman - though something tells you it might be a bad idea to point out this inconsistency with the depictions of Mordred in legends. \n\n "Maybe so, huh. Wouldn't that be funny, having distant descendents even now. But if that's true, then you'd better prove it, because I won't tolerate any weaklings as my descendents. So you're gonna fight me, unless you want to just run away now like a coward. I'll give you that one chance to flee. After that, no mercy...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

If not, then turn tail and run now, and never return to this place.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE119scathach;"I am Scathach, the guardian of Dun Scaithe, and known as the Queen of Shadows," she replies, "and you trespass upon hallowed ground. If you have an explanation, I suggest you make it now before I have no choice but to strike you down." \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, her calm expression somewhat inscrutable at first, though gradually shifting to faint amusement as you detail your search and the ancestral lines you discovered. \n\n "Strange, but perhaps there is some truth to your words, though I would not have expected my bloodline to survive. I require proof however, for if my blood runs in your veins, you must put your life on the line and test yourself against me in battle first. I will offer you one chance to turn and flee from this place, first, and I will not pursue. Once the fight begins, though, there will be no quarter given.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE119helenoftroy;"I am Helen, the Queen of Sparta, sometimes known as Helen of Troy," she replies, "and you intrude upon my tomb. Have some reason for doing so, perhaps, or are you simply another would-be looter?" \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, her expression somewhat incredulous at first, though gradually shifting to amusement as you detail your search and the ancestral lines you discovered. \n\n "Perhaps it is as you say, that you are my descendent. But if that is true, then you should know that it may be as much a curse as a blessing. I was reknowned for my beauty, true, but it was that same beauty that sparked wars where men fought to possess me and all that I had. Is that truly a mantle you wish to take up?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE119medb;"I am Medb, the Queen of Connacht," she replies, "and you trespass in my tomb.

DWE119gilgamesh;"I am Gilgamesh, the greatest of Kings," he replies, "and you trespass upon hallowed ground, mongrel. If you care to try and offer an excuse, I suggest you make it now before I decide to end your offense by striking you down." \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, his expression inscrutable at first, before slowly shifting to bemusement as he regards you and your tale. \n\n "Strange, but perhaps there is some truth to your words. I would not have expected my bloodline to survive this long. I require proof however, that it has not grown diluted over the centuries. If my blood runs true in your veins, you must put your life on the line and prove yourself against me in battle. I will offer you one chance to turn and flee from this place, first, and I will not pursue. Once the fight begins, though, there will be no quarter given.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE119cuchulainn;"I'm Cu Chulainn, the hero of Ulster," he remarks, "and you happen to be somewhere you shouldn't be. Now I'm patient, but you'd better hurry up with any explanation, before I have to assume you're just another looter, and... you get the idea." He taps his spear at that. \n\n You attempt to explain yourself and your purpose here, his expression calm at first, before slowly shifting to almost friendly amusement as he regards you and your tale.  \n\n "Huh, a descendent? Never really gave much thought to that part of my legacy. If that's true, though, then I'd expect you can prove your worth in a fight. So what do you say - up to the challenge? I won't hold back... better turn and run now if you aren't.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE120name;The Battle of Wits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE120desc;"Excellent!" she pronounces with a smile, and turns away from you for a moment, reaching for something behind her, before turning back and presenting a pair of ornate wine goblets, setting one in front of you, and one in front of herself. "And now the battle of wits begins. I placed poison in one of these wine glasses. You must tell me where the poison is. Take your cup and make your choice. Guess right, and my favor is yours. Guess wrong, and... well, with any luck, your death will be swift.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE120optA;Clearly I cannot choose the wine in front of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE120optB;Clearly I cannot choose the wine in front of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE120optC;"...they're both poisoned, aren't they.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE122name;Survival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE122desc;As soon as you swallow, it becomes quite clear you chose poorly. The sickly sweet tasting wine begins to burn the moment it hits your throat, the fire spreading with growing intensity as it sinks down into your gullet. You gasp for breath and claw at your constricting throat, eyes bulging as you stare up at the grinning figure of Semiramis, who stands there calmly watching you choke. Is this where it all comes to an end? Your heartbeat thuds, echoing in your ear, and each moment seems an eternity. And yet... despite the pain, death does not come. You wheeze and sputter, lying on the floor in pain. She watches, and could easily end your life and suffering, but does not. After a seeming eon of it, she finally speaks. \n\n "Well, it looks like despite your foolish choice, you managed to survive. I must say I'm impressed, for that is no small feat against one of the deadliest toxins known... even if you likely won't survive unscathed." She chuckles briefly, before continuing. "I suppose your endurance is a worthy enough treat, even if you lack the sense to know that facing off against someone else on such a prepared battle is foolish.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE122optA;Nod weakly as she speaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE123name;A Clever Choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE123desc;Semiramis blinks, and then claps her hands, smiling almost gleefully - a feat of some minor dexterity given the spikes worn against her palms. "Oh, you do have some wit about you, don't you? Yes, of course they're both poisoned. I said I poisoned one, I didn't mention anything about whether I poisoned the second. And knowing that, you'd be a fool to drink from either. Well done, indeed..." She pauses for a moment, regarding you, before nodding. "Yes, I think you will do, indeed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE123optA;"Thank you, your majesty.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE124name;The Favor of an Empress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE124desc;Semiramis steps forward, carefully removing her gloves, along with the palm-spikes, and hands them to you. "Here, take these as a symbol of my favor. They may take a little getting used to, but they can be quite useful both in combat, and when you need to discretely poison someone." She then smiled, before adding, "Or not so discretely." She stepped back, before continuing, "Now go and return, and make certain that my name and legend is not forgotten, child of my children." \n\n And with that, she seems to fade into the darkness, as if she might have never been there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DWE125name;The Duel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE125mordreddesc;You draw your weapon, facing off against her, as she slides forth her impressive-looking blade. Staring at it, you could almost swear that reddish light emanates from it, trailing behind it with each motion. An almost manic grin overcomes Mordred's face as she gets ready for the fight - clearly excited and relishing this match, despite the promise of a deadly end. "Alright then, let's see what you've got!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE125scathachdesc;You draw your weapon, facing off against her, as she slowly twirls that wicked red spear. The weapon almost seems alive in her hands, hungry and pulsing, though perhaps that could just be your imagination. Her features slip into an almost preternatural calm as she stares back at you, clearly unafraid and prepared. "Let us begin, then..." she announces, before moving to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE125gilgameshdesc;You draw your weapon, facing off against him, as he draws forth an ornate blade seemingly from thin air, gripping it by the hilt. "As a claimed descendent of mine, I will do you the honor of fighting on even terms, and not make use of my Treasury," he announces, full of confidence as he strikes a formal fighting stance. "Now show me your true fury and valor!" he commands as he moves forward to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE125cuchulainndesc;You draw your weapon, facing off against him, as he slowly twirls that wicked red spear.

DWE127name;Injured but Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE127mordreddesc;The battle is fierce, with Mordred fighting like a woman possessed, almost without regard for her own safety. She presses you hard, and nearly has you several times. In the end, though, you are the one who manages to remain standing, even if you have paid a steep price with injuries. She coughs, blood flowing down over her face, and grins at you nonetheless. "Damn... you fight harder than you looked. Guess maybe you do have what it takes, after all..." She wheezes a little, and coughs again, spitting up a little blood, before motioning you over, and taking her sword and turning it to offer the hilt to you. "Here... you're worthy. Take Clarent, and wield it well." As you reach for the sword's hilt, you can see her form seems to shimmer and become insubstantial, fading into nothingness as you grasp the all too real blade, leaving you to wonder if she was ever really there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE127scathachdesc;The battle is fierce, and Scathach fights like a whirlwind, constantly on the move, probing and parrying. It is all you can do to keep up at times, and she presses you hard. Several times it seems like she nearly has you as that spear rends your flesh. In the end, though, you are the one who manages to remain standing, even if you have paid a steep price with injuries. She collapses to the ground, defeated, only to smile up at you. "You fight well... well enough that there is little I could teach you I think." She motions you over, taking her spear and turning it sideways, holding it up in offer to you. "Here... Take Gae Bolg, and wield it well. It was a gift I gave to a student of mine long ago, when he surpassed me, and now it is yours by the same right." As you reach for the spear's shaft, you can see her form seems to shimmer and become insubstantial, fading into the shadows as you grasp the all too real weapon, leaving you to wonder if she was ever really there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE127gilgameshdesc;The battle is fierce, with Gilgamesh seemingly able to counter your every move as if he had seen each hundreds of times before. He presses you hard, and nearly has you several times, with his blade biting into your flesh. In the end, though, you are the one who manages to remain standing, even if you have paid a steep price with injuries. He bows, formally, making a gesture of surrender, before gazing back at you with that same look of confidence - though now there seems to be some measure of approval in his gaze. "You are truly a respectable warrior, and a fierce combatant. Perhaps your blood is diluted, but I judge you worthy nonetheless." He stands again, his blade disappearing, and reaches to pull an ornate scepter seemingly from thin air, before holding it out as if offering it to you. "Take this as a symbol of royal authority. Let all who see it know in whose lineage you stand." As you reach for the scepter, you can see his form seem to shimmer and become insubstantial, fading into nothingness as you grasp the all too real item, leaving you to wonder if he was ever really there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DWE127cuchulainndesc;The battle is fierce, and Cu Chulainn fights like a whirlwind, constantly on the move, probing and parrying. It is all you can do to keep up at times, and he presses you hard. Several times it seems like he nearly has you as that spear rends your flesh. In the end, though, you are the one who manages to remain standing, even if you have paid a steep price with injuries. He collapses to the ground, defeated, only to smile up at you. "You fight pretty well there... almost feel like I'm back facing off against my teacher, except I got the better of her in the end." He motions you over, taking his spear and turning it sideways, holding it up in offer to you. "Here... Take Gae Bolg, and wield it well. It was a gift from Scathach when I defeated her, and now it is yours by the same right." As you reach for the spear's shaft, you can see his form seems to shimmer and become insubstantial, fading into the darkness as you grasp the all too real weapon, leaving you to wonder if he was ever really there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

"You are truly a strong warrior, and a fierce combatant. As strong as any I have faced, perhaps. I judge you worthy of my legacy and my blade." He staggers to his feet, and turns his blade around, holding it out and offering the hilt to you. "Take Balmung, my sword... may it serve you as well, or better, than it served me.

Finally, after what seems like hours of questioning, she pronounces, "Enough. I am satisfied... you are no fool, and a most capable ruler indeed, at least as I judge. That may not be enough, of course, for even the best ruler may find themselves at the mercy of Fate. Nonetheless, I cannot ask anything more."

dwe_prisoner2T;A Seductive Offer from a Prisoner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwe_prisoner2lesbian;As you visit the jails to check on the prisoners, you notice that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is watching you. Likely she is up to something, though what isn't immediately apparent. On questioning her further, however, she takes a suddenly friendly turn, before making a rather lewd proposal... to let me use her for sex, in exchange for her release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dwe_prisoner3TReply;Your Captor's Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwe_prisoner3Refused;[From.GetTitledFirstName] merely laughs mockingly at your offer, with a cruel look in their eyes. "You must think quite a lot of yourself if you think I would be interested in someone as pathetic as you, even in the slightest. Enjoy rotting in your cell, you wretched harlot.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwe_prisoner3lesbianvirginity;[From.GetTitledFirstName] looks at you for a moment, as if considering your offer, and then orders you to disrobe. Once you are naked, she dismisses the guards, perhaps having reassured herself it isn't some sort of trick. She takes her sweet time with you, too, lewdly exploring and tasting your body, forcing you to experience her own in turn, and to use your tongue and fingers to bring her to climax. Finally, she slides between your legs as you lie back, her fingers and tongue moving to tease your sex. Not content simply to pierce your maidenhead, either, she works to compel your body to orgasm, regardless of your own desires, leaving you somewhat humiliated... though as she finally rises, you hear her ordering the guards to prepare for your release, fulfilling her end of the bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Once you are naked, he dismisses the guards, perhaps having reassured himself it isn't some sort of trick. He takes her sweet time with you, too, lewdly exploring and groping your body, forcing you to part your lips and to take his cock inside your mouth, sucking on him until he is fully hard. Finally, he pushes you back, sliding up between your legs as his erection prods at your sex. He isn't terribly gentle either, forcing himself roughly into your virgin folds, causing you to gasp as you feel your hymen tearing. He thrusts atop you, pawing at your breasts, before he pulls back, withdrawing his cock, stained with your smeared virgin blood, and sprays his seed across your belly and breasts, leaving you somewhat humiliated... though as he finally turns to go, you hear him ordering the guards to prepare for your release, fulfilling his end of the bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

He thrusts atop you, pawing at your breasts, his urgency increasing as he pushes as deeply inside you as he can before grunting at the moment of his release, his throbbing cock erupting inside your sex. He continues rutting atop you until he finally begins to tire of it, laying atop you for a moment before he pulls back, withdrawing his dripping cock, a trickle of his seed dribbling from the folds of your sex, leaving you humiliated... though as he finally turns to go, you hear him ordering the guards to prepare for your release, fulfilling his end of the bargain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
